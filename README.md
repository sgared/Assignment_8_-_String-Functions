# Assignment_8_-_String-Functions
Purpose:  The purpose of this assignment is to utilize python programming in practical setting to solve real world problems.  Skills: In order to complete this assignment you will need to  use critical thinking to write code to answer the questions  practice Python fundamentals and best practices
 a.What is the purpose of this program?
The first question tasks the program with determining the type of input entered by users, such as letters, numbers, and symbols. The program should count how many of each were entered.
The second question requires the program to extract the first letter of each line of the input and print out the coded messages.

b. What does this program take as input?
Both programs take strings as input.

c. What is the expected output of the program?
The first program outputs numeric values, letters, and symbols.

d. What type of execution is included in your program?
The program includes repeated execution, reuse of code, input handling, output generation, sequencing, and conditionals.

e. How could your program be improved?
Both programs could be improved to be more robust and handle errors more effectively, ensuring they are not easily thrown off.
